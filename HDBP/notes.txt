Heart's Desire: Blue Planet notes

battle commands & UI:
- enemies
  - tap to focus-target
	- tap and hold for info
	- swipe from hero to attempt push
- hero
  - tap for...?
	- 
- lower canvas (always the same?):
	- command grid
	  - config
		  - show animations
			- swap canvas positions
			- change avatar? heh
		- switch to powers? or tap hero for this?
		- map?
		- escape? (forfeit, basically)
		- undo move
		- info on active enemy syncs? eh
	- powers grid in battle
	  - tap usable power -> use
		- tap and hold for info
		- swipe to switch between grids
	- powers grid outside of battle
	  * upper canvas has collection? drag down? wait, no, that sounds super hard to do >_>
		  * maybe upper canvas temporarily disappears and lower canvas stretches up, revealing collection with drag-and drop functionality? + a dismiss button?
		- tap to open power-swap menu
		- tap and drag to rearrange in grid
		- tap and hold for info
		
does pushing an enemy always succeed but you take a little damage? or it costs more AP? something so that it's not random?

extra modes: randomized treasure, survival (random treasure after each wave)

screen modes: scale, stretch

ability to change graphics by dragging and dropping files with specific dimensions and names? then include a "bonus pack" of graphics w/ the download? :)


COPIED FROM AN EMAIL TO MYSELF:

BE next: got a world map, sorta like CC, but gameplay & battles are like BE minus the deep character customizarion. Still battling polluyion. Map of world; battlefields have land & water. Mobile design & gameplay (2 reversible canvases!). Collect life forms for augments & special attacks; place in grid. Power syncs (passive effects only; outline-color based; DO stack & scale) and enemy syncs are things. Powers = the grid (not separate gear/skill/wish grids); can change configurations in battle for 1 AP. Gameboy graphics? Or not. Undoable turns, or at least moves? Focus target for attacks = fine. Definitely fast travel allowed. Unlock map square by square by winning battles. Maybe no walking, just tapping to navigate? Count of enemies in next-door battle screen shown ahead of time, and/or boss presence. Definitely more enemies & bosses than jam version. Land/sea/air navigation types for enemies? Heart's Desire: Blue Planet? Autosaving should be simple if you ignore battle state... but you should probably save that. At least save @ each player turn. Implement pushing enemies, too, if you're doing enemy syncs (tap and swipe through to push, i think).

Heart's Desire: Black Ocean (HDBO) outline/brainstorm

game states:
- main menu
- map/level select
- stage
- status screen
- powers selection

process outline:
- ...probably different draws+updates for different game states. that'd be a good start. consider overlays & the ability to draw multiple states together
  - 1 canvas for each?
	- autosave format is also very important. will differ depending on game state
	- states should be a stack?

object architecture:
- game
  - stages array
	  - unlocked
		- beaten
  - powers = bool array
	- current powers = power array
- enemy
  - HP
	- strength
	- script?
- stage
  - enemies array
	- reward
	- graphics...
	  - surface = bool
		- floor = bool
		- water color?
- power
  - passive or active? unsure
	
powers brainstorm:
- nudibranch: special attacks do 20% more damage if on seafloor
- urchin: attackers take damage if on seafloor
- jellyfish: attackers take damage if in open ocean
- pistol shrimp: huge damage (1 target), huge cooldown
