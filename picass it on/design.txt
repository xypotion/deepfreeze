total = 29 combinations = 29 unique people

number of people without [face feature] = 12, or 41.4% of total
- so 41% are blind
- 41% are deaf
- 41% must communicate without speaking


chance of 2 people having no face parts in common = .75^4 = 31.6% = 32% chance of mistrust


ear
- can hear you coming
- can hear <say>
- can hear <clap>

nose
- can smell you coming
- can smell <waft>
- can anticipate a <feel>

eye
- can see you coming
- can see other person's face
- can see <sign>

mouth
- can taste <share>
- can <say> 1 word each
- can <ask> about face, but fails without trust
- can <promise> to 

body (universal)
- can <sign> 1 word at a time
- can <feel> 1 face part at a time but will cause confusion if not anticipated
- can <concoct> in order to <waft> or <share>
- can <clap> or <tap> to alert other to presence
- can <bow> to induce partial trust


game flow:
- start: see first person, always with 1 of each face feature. "what is your favorite concept?" enter phrase like World Peace
- you walk over to first random person, also always with 1 of each feature. "<tell> this person about World Peace."
	- after successfully explaining your concept, you take control of them, and you must now explain the concept to the next random person
	- perfect comprehension preserves the concept, but confusion will mutate it :) World Peace, Wrold Peace, Wro Ld Peace, Wro Ld Qeace, Wrok Ld Qeace...
	- causing confusion 3 times in a row will cause the interaction to fail
	- successfully explaining your concept 3 times (not in a row!) will allow it them to understand and adopt it
- explain backup capabilities when attempts to communicate fail ("you cannot <tell> them about it because they cannot hear you. try <sign> language!")
	
"you" and "them" always labeled

...eh, this game is kinda stupid. the kooky faces are interesting, but this doesn't really sound that fun.
